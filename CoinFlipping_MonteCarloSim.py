"""Recap:
Observations: we did not analyze any historical data in this example.
Distributions: Binomial, the probability of getting heads is a 50%
Simulations: flipping 20 coins â€“ the 1st model ran 10 simulations, the 2nd model ran 10,000 simulations
Quantifications: our 2nd model was able to generate a consistent accurate normal distribution
